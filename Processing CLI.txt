*concept*
 - intercepted strings will be first split into 'terms' as a string array
 - the first term will be the command, then consecutive terms will be data
 - ex: 'set CLIDebug true' creates three strings to be fed into the interpreter
 - first stage checks the first keyword for a valid command
 - second stage directs the data to the correct method
 - third stage is a set of methods designed to interpret different commands, one method per command. 
 - in this example, the second stage would look at "CLIDebug", and either set it according to input, or display the current setting if no valid data is detected for writing
