2500mah per cell

6s4p for 10Ah per cell
24 batteries per cell, $48 per pack

total 6s 10Ah cells in 3s2p config
$300 cad for total cells

requires 6x24 18650s = 144 batteries

75V 9kw discharge = 120A draw

60A per side

4p is 15A per 18650; with a 2500mAh cell that is 6C discharge

add another two cells for 4s2p of the 6s cells is about 4C peak discharge; less if I use a higher capacity 18650
