heaters blow at constant current over 3A

If I use these in 6S, 4P:

6*16 = 96V

3A * 4 = 12A

96*12A = 1152V

 - using the thermocouples is NOT an option; they will blow all the time
 - ktm e-xc is 3.9kwh and lasts about an hour and a half; 3.9kwh / 1.5h = 2.6kw
 - 2600kw / 96v = 27A constant current
27A / 4P = ~7A
27A / 5P = 5.4A constant
